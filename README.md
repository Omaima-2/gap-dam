We have undertaken a number of tasks in this project aimed at addressing various security vulnerabilities to enhance overall system protection. These projects include tackling issues such as SQL injection, which involves malicious attempts to manipulate and gain unauthorized access to databases; shoulder surfing, where attackers try to observe and capture sensitive information by looking over someoneâ€™s shoulder; preventing brute force attacks, which are attempts to gain access through trial-and-error methods by trying numerous passwords or encryption keys; and implementing effective hashing techniques to securely store and protect sensitive data. Each of these areas has been thoroughly addressed to ensure robust security measures and safeguard against potential threats.
